        <h3 class="content__title">Two Realms</h3>
        <div class="content__description">
          <p class="content__paragraph">Titan is a planet of brute culture, used to hardship, living with nature, and doing things 
            on one's own. As young kids, they are forced out into the natural world to fend for themselves, training to become great 
            warriors. Once they've attained mastery of their environment, it is mandatory to serve some form of duty to the military, 
            whether as a warrior or healer. The civilian populus is a capable one, even if not military, as most are ex-military or 
            have been involved in some manner at some point in their life.
          </p>

          <p class="content__paragraph">Analis is a planet of knowledge, and understanding. They believe success is attained through 
            codification, and structure. They believe war is won abusing exploiting strategies with great intelligence. Children begin 
            mandatory schooling as 8 months of age, and are embued with the idea that knowledge is the ultimate power. Some of the most 
            elite agents within within the universe were birthed, and forged Analis.
          </p>

          <p class="content__paragraph">In the year 25643, driven near the brink of destruction, depleted of almost all resources, 
            the surviving citizens of Titan and Analis worked in unison to create a simulation where the best militants from both 
            world could battle it out as many times as needed until there is a clear victor. This would allow them to decide conflicts 
            outside of their reality, saving both their people from dying. Analis ultimately was tasked with starting the simulation, 
            and to run it took enormous amount of power. Such that the scientists of Analis built a Dyson Sphere around a local black 
            hole to siphon enough power from it. However the simulation essentially imploded, then exploded, surrounding and stuffing 
            the two planets into part of reality even Analis scientist had no clue where they were, or what to think of it. A purple 
            void space, surrounded by nothing, seemingly empty forever.
          </p>

          <p class="content__paragraph">Later it is theorized by Titan scientists that Titan and Analis were always meant to war, 
            and they are now stuck in a time-loop of sorts, in which they will war forever, until somehow a victor is deemed by 
            the simulation, and the simulation closes, which stops it siphoning power from the black hole. This is the most well 
            accepted theory as of now on Titan, but Analis refuses this, and mocks it.

          <p class="content__paragraph">When you join the discord server, you will be presented with the option to choose a team.
            Each team represents a planet that you can choose either to join or to fight. Once you choose your planet, you are then
            locked to specific channels, and cannot use the opposing planets channels.<br>
          <br>
            You can then do the following to help your planet:
          </p>

          <ul class="content__list">
            <li>Buy</li>
            <li>Sell</li>
            <li>Salvage</li>
            <li>Mine</li>
            <li>Farm</li>
            <li>Construct</li>
            <li>Craft</li>
            <li>Market</li>
            <li>Send</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="content__paragraph">The simulation between the planets goes on for 2 weeks. For both planets, %70 of the 
            civilization is civilian, and the other %30 is military. Each day a skirmish will take place every 2-4 hours. Players 
            can use the send command to decide what they what to send for the next skirmish. You cannot queue sending anything for 
            skirmishes, anything sent by a player will be used in the next skirmish. When a planet has %12 of the opposing planets 
            population or less, they lose, and the simulation resets.
          </p>

          <p class="content__paragraph">Each planet has unique traits, abilities, weapons, shields, and much more to take advantage 
            of, and players have the opportunity to switch teams if they'd like every simulation.
          </p>

          <p class="content__paragraph">Players can choose what type of playstyle they'd like to use. You can be a weapons 
            manufacturer, shield manufacturer. You can build hospitals, or make food. You can build schools, or and teach the 
            populus to better technology. It's a team game in the end!
