        <h1>I Made a Text Editor for Windows</h1>
        <h3>By Robert Reynolds</h3>
        <p><span class="Tab"></span>
        Fair warning, I'm opinionated, and I doubt I know what I'm talking about, but I know how to make 1's and 0's spell 'cum', and I think I'm qualified
        enough to speak on creating a text editor. If you're not trying to stuff one in a terminal, or make one cross-platform, they're pretty easy to make.
        Especially if you're using Python, and Raylib. I'm basically just walking on shoulders here. The only leg work I'm doing is coming up with an
        extensible system, implementing an LSP, and all the utilities like file saving, opening, copying, pasting, proper backspacing, and whatnot.

            I think the eco-system of personal development environments on Windows could use some less bloated tooling.
